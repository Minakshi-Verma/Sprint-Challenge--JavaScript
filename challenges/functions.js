// ==== Callbacks ====

/* Step 1: Create a higher-order function
 * Create a higher-order function named consume with 3 parameters: a, b and cb
 * The first two parameters can take any argument (we can pass any value as argument)
 * The last parameter accepts a callback
 * The consume function should return the invocation of cb, passing a and b into cb as arguments
 */
function consume(a, b, cb) {
  return cb(a, b);
}

/* Step 2: Create several functions to callback with consume();
 * Create a function named add that returns the sum of two numbers
 * Create a function named multiply that returns the product of two numbers
 * Create a function named greeting that accepts a first and last name and returns "Hello first-name last-name, nice to meet you!"
 */
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

function multiply(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}

function greeting(a, b) {
  return `Hello ${a} ${b}, nice to meet you!`;
}

/* Step 3: Check your work by un-commenting the following calls to consume(): */
console.log(consume(2, 2, add)); // 4
console.log(consume(10, 16, multiply)); // 160
console.log(consume("Mary", "Poppins", greeting)); // Hello Mary Poppins, nice to meet you!

// ==== Closures ====

// Explain in your own words why nestedfunction can access the variable internal.

"Ans- Nested function can access the varible internal because of Closure. Closure is the ability to use a code that has been identified else where. Interesting thing about closure is that we can inherit the varaible down only (and not up)."

// Explanation: we can inherit the variable down

"Ans- Yes, we can only inherit the variable down (and not up) since it is the closure characterstics that the parent pass their properties to their childern and nested function show parent-child relationship."

const external = "I'm outside the function";

function myFunction() {
  console.log(external);
  const internal = "Hello! I'm inside myFunction!";
  
  function nestedFunction() {
    console.log(internal);
  }
  nestedFunction();
}
myFunction();
